This repository holds the official implementation of the paper: **"Geo-DMS: Unified Multi-Task Driver Monitoring with 3D Geometric Priors"**.

Currently, the paper is under review at *The Visual Computer* (TVC).

## 💡 Method Overview

The architecture of the Geo-DMS framework built upon the frozen SAM 3D Body framework (DINOv3 backbone & MHR decoder), the pipeline employs an Inter-Layer Channel Aggregator (ILCA) to unify global semantics ($F_{agg}$) and a Pose-Guided Adaptive Fusion (PGAF) module to inject geometric priors via a parallel strategy.
